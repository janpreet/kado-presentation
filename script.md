### Talking Points / Script for Each Slide

These are suggestions on what to cover for each slide, focusing on the technical aspects and rationale for decisions.

#### **Slide 1: Introduction and Project Overview**

- **Objective**: Introduce the purpose and high-level goals of the Kado project.
- **Talking Points**:
  - Kado was developed as a modular infrastructure automation tool designed to streamline configuration, policy management, and orchestration across multiple tools.
  - Highlight the main challenges it addresses:
    - Consistency in configuration across different tools.
    - Security compliance and enforcement.
    - Efficiency in deployment workflows.
    - Cross-tool orchestration and automation.
  - Introduce the diagram as a high-level overview of how the components are structured.

#### **Slide 2: Technical Architecture**

- **Objective**: Explain the architecture and the key components.
- **Talking Points**:
  - Discuss why Go was chosen as the primary language for the core engine.
    - Mention Go’s strengths, like concurrency and cross-platform support.
  - Describe the modular bead system, which allows each configuration tool to act independently while being part of a unified framework.
  - Highlight the policy engine integration with OPA, ensuring configurations meet security and compliance standards.
  - The diagram shows how different components interact in a layered architecture, from the configuration manager to policy and execution.

#### **Slide 3: Implementation Workflow**

- **Objective**: Demonstrate the practical workflow of how configurations are applied.
- **Talking Points**:
  - Explain the step-by-step process that occurs when `kado set` is executed.
  - Start with how configurations are loaded, then proceed to policy validation, and finally the execution stage.
  - Describe how Kado acts as an orchestrator, validating configurations against policies and then using tools like Terraform and Ansible to apply the configurations.
  - Use the sequence diagram to illustrate the flow and decision-making process during the execution.

#### **Slide 4: Key Technical Decisions and Trade-offs**

- **Objective**: Detail the major decisions and trade-offs made in Kado's design.
- **Talking Points**:
  - Discuss the rationale for creating a custom `.kd` format rather than using YAML, noting the increased control over validation and error handling.
  - Talk about the balance between flexibility and security in Kado’s architecture:
    - OPA for security policies allows dynamic policy enforcement without hard-coding rules.
    - Keybase integration ensures secrets management is both secure and compatible with the existing tooling.
  - Use the class diagram to emphasize modularity and explain how each component has a specific role, contributing to overall flexibility and maintainability.

#### **Slide 5: Project Structure and Future Roadmap**

- **Objective**: Show the project’s structure and discuss future enhancements.
- **Talking Points**:
  - Walk through the project structure to show how configurations, templates, and policies are organized.
  - Mention the flexibility that this organization provides, enabling Kado to scale and incorporate new tools.
  - Discuss future roadmap items like:
    - Support for more infrastructure tools (e.g., CDK).
    - Improved error handling and logging.
    - Potential CI/CD integrations for automated testing and deployment.
  - Conclude by reinforcing Kado’s modularity and potential for scalability and expansion in production environments.
